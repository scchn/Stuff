         was a problem whereby events were coalesced hierarchically. For

         /Users/jsmith/Pictures might be coalesced into an event with this

         able to get an idea of whether the bottleneck happened in the

         recursively) being monitored by this stream. If you asked to

         (independent of DiskArbitration). Beware that a newly-mounted
         volume could contain an arbitrarily large directory hierarchy.
         Avoid pitfalls like triggering a recursive scan of a non-local
         filesystem, which you can detect by checking for the absence of
         the MNT_LOCAL flag in the f_flags returned by statfs(). Also be

         path to the directory from which the volume was unmounted. You
         will receive one of these notifications for every volume unmount
         event inside the kernel. This is not a substitute for the
         notifications provided by the DiskArbitration framework; you only
         get notified after the unmount has occurred. Beware that
